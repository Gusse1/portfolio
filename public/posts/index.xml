&lt;p&gt;Meatball Distortion is a physics based platformer taking place in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game the player becomes &amp;ldquo;Agent Meatball&amp;rdquo; who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Meatball Distortion is a physics based platformer taking place in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game the player becomes &amp;ldquo;Agent Meatball&amp;rdquo; who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game the player plays through six levels while gaining more knowledge about the Chef and their dealing with an entity named as &amp;ldquo;Sepsis&amp;rdquo;. The player is aided in their quest by their sidekick &amp;ldquo;Agent Bentil&amp;rdquo; (voiced by Samuli Toivanen). These dream levels get progressively more deranged and eery as the player progresses further into the Chef&amp;rsquo;s psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea for this game was born out of an inside joke between my friends. We thought it would be funny if there was a game where the player played as a Meatball and tried to avoid some horror creature along the way. I though this was a great idea and started iterating on this by taking some ideas out of how those Marble platformers play (eg. Super Monkey Ball, Marble Blast). I thought the Meatball should be heavier to control and as a logical addition, the meatball should be able to be cooked. I also thought that every platformer would be improved by a grappling hook, so I created the &amp;ldquo;spaghetti hook&amp;rdquo; which added some much needed depth and excitement to the later levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was created using Unity, Blender and Audacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;House of Sepsis is a survival horror, first person shooter that focuses on making the player uneasy and using action and puzzle solving to further immerse the player in a strange world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core of the game is resource management using the blood that the player gathers from dead enemies. This blood can be funneled into health for the player or ammo, giving the player constant interesting strategic opportunities during combat. The game also features slower moments in between the action to break up the pacing. The puzzles involve being observant and finding switches in the environment. Sometimes these switches turn off by themselves so some speed may be required from the player&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Sometimes these switches turn off by themselves so some speed may be required from the player&amp;rsquo;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atmosphere is important for eliciting this feeling of unease. In the game this is enforced through a focus on using aggressive, brutalist architecture and strong colored lighting. Among the fog the player can see huge creatures that are frozen in various positions, sometimes guiding the player down the correct path. Additionally the game includes short video clips to move the story forward and illustrate visuals that would not be possible with the playable sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was my attempt at evoking a specific feeling from the player, that being anxiety. The game&amp;rsquo;s theming, mechanics and visuals all feed into this goal. The main inspirations for this game were older PC shooters (&amp;ldquo;boomer shooters&amp;rdquo;) in terms of game feel. Otherwise I looked at a lot of art of brutalist architecture and delved into this idea of &amp;ldquo;biopunk&amp;rdquo;, although during the development of the game, this biopunk idea took a bit of a backseat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: During the creation of this game I was listening to a lot of Radiohead and the song &amp;ldquo;Myxomatosis&amp;rdquo; was something that I often used to get into the mood of working on this game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was created using Godot, Audacity, Blender and DaVinci Resolve. This was my first time using Godot so a good portion of creating this game, was learning how Godot should be used. To create the levels I ended up using the Qodot extension which allows you to create Quake levels using Trenchbroom and import them into Godot meshes. This was a really good idea, since iteration times were super quick for the levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In One Last Job the player takes control of an advanced delivery robot in the near future. The game is located in a small Finnish city where most people have mysteriously disappeared. The delivery robot is given one task: Deliver a CD to an old man&amp;rsquo;s cottage at the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The delivery robot is given one task: Deliver a CD to an old man&amp;rsquo;s cottage at the end of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gameplay loop consists of simple puzzle solving, exploring different locations, and a zen-like movement mechanic where the player rhythmically times their clicks to glide through the environment dodging the trees and trash left on the roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the player wakes up, the sun is setting and the fog is lit by the orange sun which is drawing long shadows from trees around the heavily forested narrow road. The atmosphere is a bit dreamy with the empty buildings and strong lighting and shadows. This is exemplified by the first building the player encounters, the church. With the whole town being empty, the player is left to read into the town&amp;rsquo;s daily life through posters and scattered objects. People have left their phones in the church, a poster about a lost dog is on the tree next to the church and the sunday prayer is advertised on the door of the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Last Job was created as my last project for 2024. My original plan of creating three fully finished short games was coming to an end and I wanted to reflect on this creative journey through this game. This game would showcase downtime. The time between action. Especially in games this is crucial for pacing. Games like Shadow of the Colossus and Half-Life 2 balance this line excellently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially Shadow of the Colossus was a strong point of inspiration for this project. I found the reflective power of that world particularly powerful. I credited this to a couple of factors. The vacancy of the world paired with the large towering buildings really makes you wonder about what happened in this place, why are the giants there? In addition, the powerful music of Kow Otani is stripped away in these moments and what you are left with is the galloping of your horse (Agro) and ambient sounds. With my game I wanted to explore these themes in a new environment also questioning, What if there isn&amp;rsquo;t any action? Can you create a compelling game with just downtime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was created using Godot with the Terrain3D addon, Blender, Audacity and some DaVinci Resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Mikael Gustafsson and I am a student at Aalto University with a strong passion for video games! I find the industry wholly fascinating and love to immerse myself in what video games have to offer. As such, I also quite enjoy developing my own games in my free time [see some of my projects here].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think video games have a unique ability to create compelling narratives and strong influential art. My own projects explore these themes through my unique focus on level design, environmental storytelling and some technical artistry. I love to play around with expectations and surprise the player by taking normal game conventions and flipping them on their heads. That feeling of surprise and profound discovery is something that only video games as a medium is able to offer and it is definitely something I want to keep working on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
