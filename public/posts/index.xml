&lt;p&gt;Hello! My name is Mikael Gustafsson and I am a student at Aalto University with a strong passion for video games! I find the industry wholly fascinating and love to immerse myself in what video games have to offer. As such, I also quite enjoy developing my own games in my free time [see some of my projects here].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think video games have a unique ability to create compelling narratives and strong influential art. My own projects explore these themes through my unique focus on level design, environmental storytelling and some technical artistry. I love to play around with expectations and surprise the player by taking normal game conventions and flipping them on their heads. That feeling of surprise and profound discovery is something that only video games as a medium is able to offer and it is definitely something I want to keep working on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
