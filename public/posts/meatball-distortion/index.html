<p>Meatball Distortion is a physics-based platformer set in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game, the player becomes &ldquo;Agent Meatball,&rdquo; who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However, the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover.</p>
<p>In the game, the player plays through six levels while gaining more knowledge about the Chef and his dealings with an entity named &ldquo;Sepsis.&rdquo; The player is aided in their quest by their sidekick, Agent Bentil. These dream levels get progressively more deranged and eerie as the player progresses further into the Chef&rsquo;s psyche.</p>
<p>The idea for this game was born out of an inside joke between my friends. We thought it would be funny if there was a game where the player played as a Meatball and tried to avoid some horror creature along the way. I thought this was a great idea and started iterating on this by taking some ideas out of how the genre of &ldquo;Marble platformers&rdquo; plays (eg. Super Monkey Ball, Marble Blast). I thought the Meatball should be heavier to control and as a logical addition, the meatball should be able to be cooked. I also thought that every platformer would be improved by a grappling hook, so I created the &ldquo;spaghetti hook&rdquo; which added some much-needed depth and excitement to the later levels.</p>
<p>This game was created using Unity, Blender, and Audacity. With this game, I wanted to finish something in a reasonable time frame. Having worked a fair bit with Unity previously, and having experimented with Blender the previous summer, I was determined to finish the game before the holidays. That did not end up happening but I was able to finish the game in early 2024 while simultaneously working full time which I am quite proud of. The game also has a fair amount of content, probably the most out of the games I created in 2024 with its collectibles and secret levels.</p>
