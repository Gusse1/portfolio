<p>Meatball Distortion is a physics based platformer taking place in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game the player becomes &ldquo;Agent Meatball&rdquo; who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover.</p>
<p>In the game the player plays through six levels while gaining more knowledge about the Chef and their dealing with an entity named as &ldquo;Sepsis&rdquo;. The player is aided in their quest by their sidekick &ldquo;Agent Bentil&rdquo; (voiced by Samuli Toivanen). These dream levels get progressively more deranged and eery as the player progresses further into the Chef&rsquo;s psyche.</p>
<p>The idea for this game was born out of an inside joke between my friends. We thought it would be funny if there was a game where the player played as a Meatball and tried to avoid some horror creature along the way. I though this was a great idea and started iterating on this by taking some ideas out of how those Marble platformers play (eg. Super Monkey Ball, Marble Blast). I thought the Meatball should be heavier to control and as a logical addition, the meatball should be able to be cooked. I also thought that every platformer would be improved by a grappling hook, so I created the &ldquo;spaghetti hook&rdquo; which added some much needed depth and excitement to the later levels.</p>
<p>This game was created using Unity, Blender and Audacity.</p>
