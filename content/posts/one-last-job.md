In One Last Job, the player takes control of an advanced delivery robot in a near future Finland, in a town where all of the people have mysteriously disappeared. The delivery robot is given one task: Deliver a CD to an old man's cottage at the end of the road.

The gameplay loop consists of simple puzzle solving, exploring different locations, and a zen-like movement mechanic where the player rhythmically times their clicks to glide through the environment dodging the trees and trash left on the roads.

When the player wakes up, the sun is setting and the fog is lit by the orange sun which is drawing long shadows from trees around the heavily forested narrow road. The atmosphere is a bit dreamy with the empty buildings and strong lighting. This is exemplified by the first building the player encounters, the church. With the whole town being empty, the player is left to read into the town's daily life through posters and scattered objects. People have left their phones in the church, a poster about a lost dog is on the tree next to the church and the Sunday prayer is advertised on the church door.

One Last Job was created as my last project for 2024. My original plan of creating three fully finished short games was coming to an end and I wanted to reflect on this creative journey through this game. This game would showcase downtime. The time between action. Especially in games, this is crucial for pacing. Games like Shadow of the Colossus and Half-Life 2 balance this line excellently in my opinion.

Shadow of the Colossus was a strong point of inspiration for this project. I found the reflective power of that world particularly powerful. I credited this to a couple of factors. The vacancy of the world paired with the large towering buildings makes you wonder about what happened in this place, why are the giants there? The traveling between the epic colossus boss fights gives you time to think about all of this. In addition, the powerful music of Kow Otani is stripped away in these moments and what you are left with is the galloping of your horse (Agro), the chirping of birds and the sloshing of nearby waterfalls. With my game, I wanted to explore this downtime in a new environment. What if there isn't any action? Can you create a compelling game with just downtime?

This game was created using Godot with the Terrain3D addon, Blender, Audacity, and some DaVinci Resolve. In terms of development, this was the smoothest process out of all of the three games. The vision was very clear from the beginning of the project and my laser precision with not missing my self-imposed deadlines for this project helped. I would have liked to do more with this game but I guess this would be true for any game project, big or small.
