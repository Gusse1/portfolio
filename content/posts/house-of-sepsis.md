House of Sepsis is a survival horror, first person shooter that focuses on making the player uneasy and using action and puzzle solving to further immerse the player in a strange world.

The core of the game is resource management using the blood that the player gathers from dead enemies. This blood can be funneled into health for the player or ammo, giving the player constant interesting strategic opportunities during combat. The game also features slower moments in between the action to break up the pacing. The puzzles involve being observant and finding switches in the environment. Sometimes these switches turn off by themselves so some speed may be required from the player's point of view. 

Atmosphere is important for eliciting this feeling of unease. In the game this is enforced through a focus on using aggressive, brutalist architecture and strong colored lighting. Among the fog the player can see huge creatures that are frozen in various positions, sometimes guiding the player down the correct path. Additionally the game includes short video clips to move the story forward and illustrate visuals that would not be possible with the playable sections. 

This game was my attempt at evoking a specific feeling from the player, that being anxiety. The game's theming, mechanics and visuals all feed into this goal. The main inspirations for this game were older PC shooters ("boomer shooters") in terms of game feel. Otherwise I looked at a lot of art of brutalist architecture and delved into this idea of "biopunk", although during the development of the game, this biopunk idea took a bit of a backseat.

Sidenote: During the creation of this game I was listening to a lot of Radiohead and the song "Myxomatosis" was something that I often used to get into the mood of working on this game.

This game was created using Godot, Audacity, Blender and DaVinci Resolve. This was my first time using Godot so a good portion of creating this game, was learning how Godot should be used. To create the levels I ended up using the Qodot extension which allows you to create Quake levels using Trenchbroom and import them into Godot meshes. This was a really good idea, since iteration times were super quick for the levels.
