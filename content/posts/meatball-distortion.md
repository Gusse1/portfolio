Meatball Distortion is a physics based platformer taking place in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game the player becomes "Agent Meatball" who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover. 

In the game the player plays through six levels while gaining more knowledge about the Chef and their dealing with an entity named as "Sepsis". The player is aided in their quest by their sidekick "Agent Bentil" (voiced by Samuli Toivanen). These dream levels get progressively more deranged and eery as the player progresses further into the Chef's psyche.

The idea for this game was born out of an inside joke between my friends. We thought it would be funny if there was a game where the player played as a Meatball and tried to avoid some horror creature along the way. I though this was a great idea and started iterating on this by taking some ideas out of how those Marble platformers play (eg. Super Monkey Ball, Marble Blast). I thought the Meatball should be heavier to control and as a logical addition, the meatball should be able to be cooked. I also thought that every platformer would be improved by a grappling hook, so I created the "spaghetti hook" which added some much needed depth and excitement to the later levels. 

This game was created using Unity, Blender and Audacity.
