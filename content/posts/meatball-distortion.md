Meatball Distortion is a physics-based platformer set in the dreams of a chef who really likes meatballs. In the game, the player becomes "Agent Meatball," who must cook themselves to perfection and collect all of the dream fragments while reaching the plate at the end of the level. However, the Chef has a dark secret relating to his famed meatball recipe, which the player must uncover. 

In the game, the player plays through six levels while gaining more knowledge about the Chef and his dealings with an entity named "Sepsis." The player is aided in their quest by their sidekick, Agent Bentil. These dream levels get progressively more deranged and eerie as the player progresses further into the Chef's psyche.

The idea for this game was born out of an inside joke between my friends. We thought it would be funny if there was a game where the player played as a Meatball and tried to avoid some horror creature along the way. I thought this was a great idea and started iterating on this by taking some ideas out of how the genre of "Marble platformers" plays (eg. Super Monkey Ball, Marble Blast). I thought the Meatball should be heavier to control and as a logical addition, the meatball should be able to be cooked. I also thought that every platformer would be improved by a grappling hook, so I created the "spaghetti hook" which added some much-needed depth and excitement to the later levels.

This game was created using Unity, Blender, and Audacity. With this game, I wanted to finish something in a reasonable time frame. Having worked a fair bit with Unity previously, and having experimented with Blender the previous summer, I was determined to finish the game before the holidays. That did not end up happening but I was able to finish the game in early 2024 while simultaneously working full time which I am quite proud of. The game also has a fair amount of content, probably the most out of the games I created in 2024 with its collectibles and secret levels.
